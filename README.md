# Seeded Region Growing Algorithm
**A demonstration of the seeded region growing algorithm with an HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.**

In this example we take a look on the seeded region algorithm which is an area-oriented segmentation method. An area-oriented segmentation method divides a picture a several related regions or items. With the help of this algorithm, the machine can interpret parts of an image into given items. This task can be found in the area of computer vision. With the help of this algorithm items can be recognized, positioned or freed. One of the big advantages of this method is, that this algorithm won't need a threshold for recognition of areas.
